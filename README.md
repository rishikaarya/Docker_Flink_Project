# Smart Home Energy Consumption Analysis 

## Objective

This project showcases the development of a scalable data pipeline capable of processing streaming data by combining Kafka, Apache Flink, and SQL for real-time analytics. The key objectives are to:

1. Generate synthetic datasets using Avro schema definitions.
2. Stream data into Kafka topics for further processing.
3. Leverage Apache Flink and SQL for real-time data analysis.
4. Create enriched data views to derive actionable insights.
5. Set the foundation for future data visualization with Elasticsearch and Kibana.
